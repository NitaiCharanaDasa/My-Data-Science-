    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Covariance**: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between them. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship (both variables increase or decrease together), while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship (one variable increases as the other decreases).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Correlation**: Correlation is a standardized version of covariance. It not only measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship but also scales it to a range between -1 and 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Units**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Covariance**: The unit of covariance is the product of the units of the two variables being measured. This makes it challenging to interpret covariance values, especially when dealing with variables of different units.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Correlation**: Correlation is unitless, which makes it easier to interpret. It gives a clear indication of the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range of Values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Covariance**: Covariance can take any value, including negative, positive, or zero. The magnitude of covariance is not standardized, which makes it hard to compare covariances directly between different pairs of variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Correlation**: Correlation always falls between -1 and 1. This standardization allows for easier comparison of the strength of relationships between different pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Covariance**: Covariance doesn't provide a clear indication of the strength or direction of the relationship. It simply tells you if the variables tend to change together, but it doesn't quantify the extent.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Correlation**: Correlation provides a clear and interpretable measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both covariance and correlation are measures of association between variables, correlation is generally preferred because it provides a more interpretable and standardized measure of the strength and direction of the relationship."

For example, consider a dataset of incomes where most people earn around $50,000 per year, but one individual earns $5,000,000. The mean would be substantially higher than what most people actually earn.\n",
