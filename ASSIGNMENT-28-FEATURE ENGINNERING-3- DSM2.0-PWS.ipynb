    "Q1. Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique that transforms numeric features to a specific range, typically [0, 1]. It is calculated by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. For example, if you have a dataset with values [1, 5, 10, 15], Min-Max scaling would transform them to [0, 0.25, 0.5, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, scales features by dividing each data point by its magnitude, resulting in a unit vector. Unlike Min-Max scaling, it doesn't constrain values to a specific range. For instance, given [1, 2, 3], normalization would yield [0.267, 0.535, 0.802].\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction method that identifies the principal components capturing the most variance in the data. It's used to simplify complex datasets. As an example, consider reducing a dataset's dimensions from 3 to 2 based on its principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. PCA and Feature Extraction are closely related; PCA is a technique used for feature extraction. It identifies the most informative features in a dataset. For example, if you have a dataset with multiple correlated features, PCA can help extract the key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In a food delivery recommendation system, you would use Min-Max scaling to standardize features like price, rating, and delivery time. This ensures that these features are on a similar scale, preventing one from dominating the others during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. In a stock price prediction model, PCA can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of features like company financial data and market trends. This helps manage the curse of dimensionality and focuses on the most significant components impacting stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. To perform Min-Max scaling on [1, 5, 10, 15, 20] and transform it to a range of -1 to 1, you would subtract the minimum value (1) and divide by the range (20 - 1). The result is [-0.9, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. For feature extraction using PCA on [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure], the choice of retained principal components depends on the desired explained variance. You may choose the number of components that capture a sufficiently high percentage of the total variance in the data. This decision is often made based on a cumulative explained variance plot or a pre-defined threshold.\n",
