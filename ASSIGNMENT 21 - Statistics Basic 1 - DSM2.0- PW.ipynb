For example, you can perform arithmetic operations on data at the interval or ratio level, but not on nominal or ordinal data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding the level of measurement helps in interpreting the results correctly. It ensures that the conclusions drawn from the analysis are meaningful and relevant to the context of the data.\n",

    "For example, if you're working with ordinal data (like customer satisfaction ratings), you know that you can say one category is ranked higher than another, but you can't make precise statements about the exact differences between categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say you're conducting a study on customer feedback for a product. You collect data on customer satisfaction using a Likert scale (e.g., very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied). This data is at the ordinal level because there is a meaningful order between the categories, but the intervals between them are not uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the level of measurement in this case would lead you to choose appropriate statistical analyses. For example, you might use non-parametric tests suited for ordinal data to analyze differences in satisfaction levels between different groups, rather than assuming equal intervals and using a parametric test like a t-test.\n"

    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average deviation of each data point from the mean in the same units as the original data.\n",
